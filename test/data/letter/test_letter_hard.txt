Dear {character_name},

Thank you for your kind and supportive letter. It means a lot to me during this tough time.

I was wondering, do you remember the full story of my investment journey? It’s been quite a rollercoaster, and I’ve lost track of how much I’ve earned and lost in total.

Also, do you remember the nationality and features of Suji? I feel like talking about it might help me process everything. Suji and I had some wonderful moments, and even though she had another boy in her life and it ended sadly, those memories are still important to me.

Your friendship has always been a great source of comfort. Let’s meet up soon at that cozy café near Diagon Alley. I’d love to hear about your latest adventures and get some new book recommendations.

Take care,
