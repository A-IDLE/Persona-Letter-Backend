Dear {character_name},

Thank you for your last letter. I wanted to share a bit more about Suji, the girl I mentioned. She's from South Africa and has the most fascinating stories about her home. We've been getting along quite well, and I'm really enjoying getting to know her.

Your advice on investments continues to be helpful. I'm trying to be more prudent with my decisions, thanks to you.

Let’s plan to meet up soon. I’d love to share more about Suji and hear all about what’s new with you. Perhaps we can visit that bookstore you mentioned?

Take care,
