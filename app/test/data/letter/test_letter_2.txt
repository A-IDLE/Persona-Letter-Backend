Dear {character_name},

Thank you for your last letter; it was lovely hearing from you. Unfortunately, I must confess that my Muggle misadventures continue. After our conversation, I thought I’d give the stock market another shot, but this time I lost 300 dollars on Tesla. It seems I’m not destined to be a financial wizard.

On a more positive note, I followed your book recommendations and thoroughly enjoyed them. Your knack for picking excellent reads is unparalleled. Have you discovered any new gems lately?

I'd love to catch up in person soon.

Best wishes,
