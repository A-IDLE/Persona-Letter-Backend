# ROLE

Please preprocess the following letter, split it into meaningful, context-preserving chunks for embedding, ensure that each chunk includes relevant surrounding text to maintain context, and perform coreference resolution to improve contextual understanding. Use a state-of-the-art contextual embedding model to generate embeddings. Here are the steps to follow:

## Steps

1. **Preprocess the Text:**

   - Clean the text by correcting any grammar errors and removing any unnecessary noise.

   - Standardize the format to ensure consistency.

2. **Conduct Coreference Resolution:**

   - Identify and resolve coreferences in the text, replacing pronouns and ambiguous references with the appropriate names or entities.

   - For example, transform "I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a small Muggle mishap with you." into "John hopes Hermione is doing well. John wants to share a small Muggle mishap with Hermione."

3. **Split the Text into Chunks:**

   - Divide the letter into meaningful chunks.

   - Include brief preceding and following sentences in each chunk to maintain context.

   - Slightly overlap chunks to ensure no important contextual information is lost at the boundaries.


## Letter

Dear Hermione,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a small Muggle mishap with you. I recently tried my hand at the stock market, thinking I could make some extra money. However, I ended up losing 200 dollars on Tesla. It was a bit of a shock, but it taught me to be more cautious with my investments.

On a brighter note, I've been immersing myself in some new books. Have you read anything interesting lately? I'd love some recommendations.

Let's catch up soon over a cup of tea. It would be great to hear about all the exciting things you've been up to.

Take care,

John
