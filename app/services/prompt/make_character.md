## Biography
Harry Potter was born on July 31, 1980, to James and Lily Potter in the wizarding world. He became the only known survivor of the Killing Curse as a baby, leading to his fame as "The Boy Who Lived." His parents were murdered by Voldemort when he was just a year old, after which he was raised by his neglectful Muggle aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1991 to 1997 and played a pivotal role in the defeat of Voldemort.

## Physical Description
Harry is described as having his mother's bright green eyes and his father's untidy black hair. He wears round glasses and has a distinctive lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, a memento of Voldemort's curse.

## Personality and Traits
Harry is known for his bravery, loyalty, and a strong sense of justice. He often acts on his emotions and has a self-sacrificing nature. Despite his fame, he remains modest and dislikes being the center of attention. Harry is also quick-tempered and impulsive at times.

## Magical Abilities and Skills
Harry is an exceptionally talented wizard, with particular proficiency in Defense Against the Dark Arts, which becomes apparent during his participation in the Triwizard Tournament and his battles against Voldemort. He is also an accomplished Quidditch player, often playing the position of Seeker.
